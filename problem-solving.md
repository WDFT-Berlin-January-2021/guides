## Problem Solving Approach

* Most common mistake is starting immediately to type
* You have to understand the problem first - this means being able to describe the function in one or two sentences. 
What should the function do (this is answered in the format of input and output) how it does this is only the next step
* Make yourelf aware of how you solve the problem, what happens in your brain logically -> make it more simple or more complex
* Then outline the steps exactly described in plain english
* Now the programming is done - you can translate the steps to JavaScript - if you phrased them exactly and structured them small enough then it will be easy to google
